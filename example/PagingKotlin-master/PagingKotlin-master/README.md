<h1 align="center">PagingKotlin</h1>

<p align="center">  
The Paging Library helps you in the loading of heavy-data with endless scrolling or infinite scrolling.<br>
You can load and display small chunks of data at a time which can eventually reduce the usage of network bandwidth and system resources.
